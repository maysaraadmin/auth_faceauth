Moodle Face Authentication Plugin
This Moodle plugin integrates a facial recognition authentication system into your Moodle login process. The plugin uses webcam capture to verify users' identities before granting access to the Moodle platform. It provides an additional layer of security by enabling users to authenticate using their faces.

Features
Webcam Integration: Allows users to authenticate using their webcam.
Face Capture: Users can capture a snapshot of their face for authentication.
Retry Option: If the first attempt fails, users can retry the capture.
Message Display: Provides success or error messages for user feedback.
Loader: Displays a loading message during the authentication process.
Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile views.
Installation
1. Clone or Download the Plugin
Clone or download the plugin to your Moodle instance's auth directory. You can do this by running the following command in your Moodle root directory:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/moodle-auth-faceauth.git auth/faceauth
2. Install the Plugin
Navigate to your Moodle site's administration page.
Go to Site administration > Notifications.
Moodle will automatically detect the new plugin and prompt you to install it.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
3. Enable the Plugin
After installation, go to Site administration > Plugins > Authentication > Manage authentication.
Find the Face Authentication plugin in the list and enable it.
4. Add the JavaScript and CSS Files
The plugin includes the necessary JavaScript and CSS files for facial recognition functionality. These are automatically added to the page by the plugin, but you can ensure theyâ€™re included by adding the following lines in the login/index.php file:

php
Copy code
$PAGE->requires->js('/auth/faceauth/faceauth.js');  // Include your custom JS for facial recognition
$PAGE->requires->css('/auth/faceauth/style.css');   // Include the CSS for styling
5. Configure the Plugin
You may configure additional settings (such as webcam resolution and timeout durations) by editing the plugin configuration page.

Usage
How to Use Face Authentication
Once the plugin is enabled, users can authenticate using the following steps:

Capture Face: Users can click the Capture Face button to take a snapshot of their face.
Retry Option: If the face capture fails, users can click the Retry button to try again.
Submit: After a successful capture, users can click Submit to send their face data to the server for authentication.
Success/Failure: Once the submission is processed, users will be notified whether the face was successfully enrolled or if there was an issue with the capture.
User Interface Elements

Canvas: Holds the captured image (invisible during normal operation).
Image Preview: Displays a preview of the captured face image.
